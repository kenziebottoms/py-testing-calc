# Calculator Unit Tests

Just like you did in JavaScript when you learned about Jasmine, you're going to create a class that test the functionality of a `Calculator` class.

#### Starter code for [test class](sample/calculator.test.py) | [calculator class](sample/calculator.py)
> **Note**: The [`setUpClass`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.setUpClass) method below must have the `@classmethod` decorator above it. 

## Running the test class

```
python calculator.test.py -v
```
